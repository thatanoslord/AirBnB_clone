# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Project Description

The initial step in building a clone of the AirBnB web application is this project. The objective is to create a command-line interface (CLI) that simulates the fundamental features of AirBnB by managing and storing data models. For our upcoming web-based front end and API interfaces, this console-based program will act as the back end.

## Features

- Object management (create, update, delete) for different models: `User`, `State`, `City`, `Amenity`, `Place`, and `Review`.
- Serialization and deserialization of objects to JSON format.
- File storage to save and retrieve objects across sessions.
- An organized structure with modular Python packages.

## Usage

The command interpreter (CLI) is used to manage and perform operations on AirBnB objects. You can enter commands to create, update, delete, and retrieve different types of data models.
